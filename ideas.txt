Idea: When developers submit a script heavy add-on, (or any at all) have an option for them to explain the code in their own words.
They can use as much or as little detail as they want, but it will speed up the review process if someone looks at the code with some idea of wtf is going on.
For example: "I divided the add-on into four main script files, a server.cs that launches the others, a player.cs that handles player-related tracking functions..."
