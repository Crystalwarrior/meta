This is a list of planned features to be integrated into the BAM client at the convenience of server-sided add-ons, so they will not require a client-sided add-on.
Feel free to contribute.

#### Access to "Default FOV" value

The BAM client will send the default FOV on connect as well as whenever it's changed, so that weapon packs and such can correctly reset their FOV.

#### Server-sided keybinds

Servers can request the client to bind a key to a certain command, which will prompt the user and allow them to bind a temporary key.

#### Controlled 2D sound (for music)

Servers can send commands to the client to start and stop a certain audio profile.

#### Access to typed message on death

If a client was typing at the time of death and has opted in, the BAM client will send their message to the server (not as a chat message) as they die.

#### GUI downloading
A client can have a setting checked whether or not to download custom GUI's.
